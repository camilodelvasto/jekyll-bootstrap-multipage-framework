#What's this?
This is a basic template for quickly coding static websites using jekyll, bootstrap, fontawesome and masonry. This is the multi page version, useful for blogs and simple websites (not one page).

##How to install
This is just a jekyll site, so head over to [](http://jekyllrb.com/) for more details.

##Have fun!
And please let me know if you happen to encounter issues. All silly texts are made by me and carry no significant meaning.
