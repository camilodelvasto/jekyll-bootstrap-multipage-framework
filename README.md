#What's this?
This is a basic template for quickly coding static websites using jekyll, bootstrap, fontawesome and masonry. This is the multi page version, useful for blogs and simple websites (not one page).

All extras: bootstrap, fontawesome and masonry plugin are loaded first from a CDN and if that fails then the local files are downloaded (available on /lib). It also includes a dynamic menu with grouping (useful if you don't want all your pages displayed in the same menu) and sorting via *weight* variable (configurable on front matter).

##How to install
This is just a jekyll site, so head over to [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/) for more details.

##Have fun!
And please let me know if you happen to encounter issues. All silly texts are made by me and carry no significant meaning. Thanks to [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8340170/jekyll-automatically-highlight-current-tab-in-menu-bar) and [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9053066/sorted-navigation-menu-with-jekyll-and-liquid) for the hints on how to achieve the menu thing.

##To do

- Make the menu responsive
- Improve description and footer (looks messy)
